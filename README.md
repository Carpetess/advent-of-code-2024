# Advent of code 2024
### What is this repository?
It holds the solutions to all the problems from advent of code 2024.
They are all solved using the Rust programing language.

### Bro why rust? No one uses it...
I chose rust for this project because I wanted to learn more about the language and
practice it. This language has some very interesting features that have, time and time
again changed my perspective in programming. And also I'm doing this for fun.
