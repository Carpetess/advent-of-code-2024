# Advent of code 2024
### What is this repository?
It holds the solutions to all the problems from advent of code 2024.
They are all solved using the Rust programing language.

### Bro why rust? No one uses it...
I chose rust for this project because I wanted to learn more about the language and
practice it. This language has some very interesting features that have, time and time
again changed my perspective in programming. And also I'm doing this for fun.

### Day 1:

This exercise was really easy, so I decided to do something extra because it was the first day and I
wanted a bit of a challenge. I implemented my own merge sort to practice the algorithm in Rust to sort
the lists and the rest was smooth sailing.

### Day 2:

This was also rather simple. The hardest part was figuring out how to exactly structure the if statements.
Part two was also easy.

### Day 3:

This one was very interesting, dealing with the parsing was something I hadn't done until now and was
very fun! Learned a lot.

### Day 4: 

This one was a headache, I've already tried to make a project like this exercise, but more broad,
gave up halfway because of how hard it was, even though it was a few months ago, after solving this,
I think I'll get back to that project.
